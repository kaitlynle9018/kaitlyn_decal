# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
# The command would be cd ../..
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
# ~ means home directory.
# 3) What's the difference between an abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
# The absolute path refers to the entire path to a file while a relative path depends on the current working directory to determine the file location. 
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
# The command would be cd ~.
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do?
# It would remove the files in current working directory.
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
# "git add" stages a specific file. "git commit" commits the changes in GitHub with a message. "git push" pushes the changes to Github.
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
# "git status" shows the status of the repository, including which files have been modified, which files have been staged, which branch we're on and if it's up to date, and if there are untracked files.
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
# Connecting my GitHub repository to my local one. I had to debug it by restarting the entire process of connecting my local to remote repository over again because I had connected my GitHub repository to the wrong folder.
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
# Cloning a repository creates a local copy on our computers while pulling from the repository gets the latest changes.
# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# I have been doing Vietnamese traditional dance for almost 9 years (and still counting!)
